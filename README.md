# concentration-game

This is a basic memory match game. The object of the game is to click two cards, and then check to see if they match. If the cards match, they stay flipped over, and count towards your match score. If the cards do not match, you do not get the point, and they flip back over. You will start with three stars, and as the moves are counted, you will lose a star. Improve your star rating by making fewer mistakes!
